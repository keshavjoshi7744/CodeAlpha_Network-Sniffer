# CodeAlpha_Network-Sniffer.
This Python-based network sniffer uses Scapy to capture and analyze network traffic. It filters and displays IP, ARP, and ICMP packets, providing detailed insights into their contents. The script captures a limited number of packets, saves them in a .pcap file, and can be analyzed later with tools like Wireshark.
